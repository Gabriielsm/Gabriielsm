### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Gabriel** and I'm in high school.

I am a technology lover and my passion is: 
- develop plugins in JavaBukkit;
- create systems using Node.js;
- create mobile applications using React Native. 
As well, I use JDA to create Discord's Bots that can have integration with a Minecraft Server.

I am currently delving into back-end systems development using javascript and node.js
