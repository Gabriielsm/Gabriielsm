### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Gabriel**, I am 16 and I am at high school.

I am a technology lover and my passion is:
- develop plugins using JavaBukkit and Spigot API;
- create systems using Node.js;
- create mobile apps using React Native.
In addition, I use JDA to create Discord Bots that can be integrated with a Minecraft server.

I am currently delving into the development of back-end systems using javascript and node.js
